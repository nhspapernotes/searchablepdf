This gentleman who came to see me to find out if he has Fibromyalgia has a lot of history of 20
years of pain in many different places. 13 years ago he had increased symptoms particularly with
bilateral plantar fasciitis. Most symptoms seem to start on the right side followed by knee pain ? torn
meniscus. He saw an orthopaedic surgeon and has had back and shoulder pain for which he saw a
chiropractor. At one stage there was a suggestion he may have Charcot Marie Tooth but EMG at
the Royal Free ruled this out and he wondered about Fibromyalgia. His main problem now is back,
knee and feet pain. He sleeps poorly for sometime. Sometimes he has no sleep for 1-2 nights,
wakes unrefreshed. Back pain from the base of the neck to the mid back, with no diurnal variation.
He had Gabapentin, 900 mg made him feel unwell, Amitriptyline 30 mg at night helps. He also has
restless arms and legs.
Pointless paragraph
Past medical history right inguinal hernia repair, hiatus hernia, depression, anxiety, currently on
Omeprazole 40 mg a day, Sertraline for some 3-4 years, previously Venlafaxine, Tramadol 100 mg
bd and Paracetamol 1000 mg bd. No known drug allergies. He writes blogs, lives alone, on
Incapacity Benefit previously, was a driver for Land Rover, non smoker, stopped 1-2 years ago, no
alcohol. He has occasional palpitations, ?irritable bowel type symptoms.
Pointless Paragraph
On examination general examination was normal, decreased extension, lateral flexion lumbar spine,
hyperextensible little fingers and thumbs, slightly tender over the heels, straight leg raising 30-40 °.
Hmm and the KNEE?!
This gentleman certainly has a reasonable history for Fibromyalgia. He is doing reasonably well on
Amitriptyline and probably would be worth going back on to a lower dose of Gabapentin as the
higher doses may not be that useful and lower doses do not give him side effects.
LIE! Was expecting this possibility!
He is quite keen to exercise and we know that a program of gradual increase in aerobic exercise is
really the way to get people out of this problem. I think he will do well. I don't think he will have any
severe problems. We will also obtain the results of an MRI at Chase Farm Hospital, Dr. Myer which
was recorded as normal about 12 months ago just to check.
Extremely VAGUE! And the KNEE?!
Thanks for help.
Kind regards.
