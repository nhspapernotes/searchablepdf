Dear Parent / Carer
This is to remind you that if you have not yet vaccinated your child against flu, please
do so as it will protect your child and others from flu.
All children aged 2-4years old and children in school year 1,2 and 3 are eligible
for free NHS flu vaccination - in Swindon this is being delivered by the GP, so
please call your surgery for an appointment, if your child has not yet been
vaccinated.
The other eligible people for the NHS flu vaccination are:
• All pregnant women,
All people aged 65 and older
All carers and
All people aged 65 and younger with any of the following chronic
conditions:
• chronic respiratory disease (including asthma that requires continuous
or repeated use of inhaled or systemic steroids or with previous
exacerbations requiring hospital admission)
• chronic heart disease
• chronic renal disease
• chronic liver disease
• chronic neurological disease
• immunosuppression
• diabetes mellitus.
I would strongly encourage everyone eligible to get their flu vaccination as soon as
possible either through their GP or pharmacy (adults only).
Please also note that it is very important that if your child has flu-like symptoms they
should stay away from school until they have fully recovered. This is to avoid
spreading the infection to others as much as possible
